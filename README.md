## Setup  
  
get the code:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/HorayNarea/Akktool
cd Akktool
```
  
or  
  
```sh
wget https://github.com/HorayNarea/Akktool/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd Akktool-master
```  
  
optional, use a virtual environment:  
```sh
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```  
  
to install and run, just:  
`./start.sh`  
or  
`./start.sh /path/to/csvfile`  
if you also want to import some members from /path/to/csvfile

this will do the following:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
    python import.py $1
fi
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver
```  
  
  
now open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser  
  
  
to stop:  
Ctrl+C (if you're running inside a virtual environment: `deactivate`) and you're done \o/
