cd Akktool
```
  
or  
  
```sh
wget https://github.com/HorayNarea/Akktool/archive/master.zip

cd Akktool-master
```  
  
to install and run, just:  
`./start.sh`

this will setup a virtual environment (if you have virtualenv installed) and do the following:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
if [ "$1" != "" ]
  then
    python manage.py syncdb
    python import.py $1
fi
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver
```  
  
  
now open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser

Ctrl+C and you're done \o/
